# ASUS-H97-Plus-OSX86-setup-
EFI folder (sans serials) for MacOS


As the title says, I've included my current (as of Sequoia 15.6) EFI folder for the Asus H97 Plus. It has had commendable performance for years. The hardware includes
- an Intel AX210 PCIE Wifi card
- a Radeon RX 580 GPU

Everything works, sleeps/wakes/WOL are fine.

Who knows, maybe it can be upgraded for Tahoe some day ;-)
