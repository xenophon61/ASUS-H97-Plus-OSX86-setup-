# ASUS-H97-Plus setup for MacOS
EFI folder (sans serials) for MacOS


As the title says, I've included my current (as of Sequoia 15.6 / Opencore 0105) EFI folder for the Asus H97 Plus. It has had commendable performance for years. The hardware includes
- an Intel AX210 PCIE Wifi card
- a Radeon RX 580 GPU

Everything works, sleeps/wakes/WOL are fine. Hope this helps someone, somewhere, sometime.

Who knows, maybe it can be upgraded for Tahoe some day ;-)
